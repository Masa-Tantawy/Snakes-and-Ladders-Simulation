# Snakes-and-Ladders-Simulation
Snakes and ladder is an ancient board game that originated in India. The central concept is that the game consists of a minimum of 2 players, all initially starting at zero in a numbered grid, and each gets a turn to roll the die. The number they get is the steps they have to advance. Encountering a snake on their stopping cell indicates they have to go back to the cell at the end of the snake whereas a ladder refers to the opposite. The objective of the game is to reach the final square before your opponents to win.
This project originated out of curiosity to understand the different scenarios to win the game. Some of the questions that were raised include:
- How many turns are we expected to play to win the game?
- Is it possible to win the game even though the player didnâ€™t land on
a ladder throughout the whole game?
- Can we encounter snakes and still win the game? If so, how many
snakes?
- Does the dimension of the board affect the number of turns for
each player?
- Does the number of ladders and snakes existing in a board game
affect the number of turns?
Hence, a code was written in R and Python, both almost identical, to analyze the game results by simulating playing the game a large number of times under different conditions.
